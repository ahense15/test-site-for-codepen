  <p id="paragraph1">Rosa Marie Burger is a survivor of the holocaust. Her mother was an English citizen while her father was German. She grew up in Northern Germany as a German Jew and faced many challenges as the nazis began to take over when she was 17 years old. She saw great amounts of people taken away, some of them were her friends that she had grown up with. There were many bombings and the food was rationed. After many years of hardships, the Americans came into their town. The Germans were terrified and didn't know what to expect, but it turns out the Americans didn't know what to expect either. The soldiers were kind to them all for the most part and Rosa ended up working for the American lieutenant. In 1948, Rosa left Germany and fell in love with an American soldier. </p>
